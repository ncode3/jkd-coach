The main issue I'm seeing is guard discipline - you're dropping it 38% of the time.\n\nYour left guard is averaging 0.42 (should be 0.55+). When you throw combinations, you're leaving your head exposed.\n\nFix this with the 'punch-and-return' drill:\n- 3 rounds on the heavy bag\n- Every combo MUST end with hands back to face\n- Focus on form, not power\n- Video yourself and watch for guard drops\n\nHip rotation at 28\u00b0 is weak - wider stance + resistance band work will help."}
